David Kolb published his learning styles model in 1984 from which he developed his learning style inventory.

Kolb's experiential learning theory works on two levels: a four stage cycle of learning and four separate learning styles.  Much of Kolb’s theory is concerned with the learner’s internal cognitive processes.

Kolb states that learning involves the acquisition of abstract concepts that can be applied flexibly in a range of situations.  In Kolb’s theory, the impetus for the development of new concepts is provided by new experiences.

“Learning is the process whereby knowledge is created through the transformation of experience” (Kolb, 1984, p. 38).

Kolb's experiential learning style theory is typically represented by a four stage learning cycle in which the learner 'touches all the bases':

Kolb's cycle in detail:

1. Concrete Experience - A new experience of situation is encountered, or a reinterpretation of existing experience.

2. Reflective Observation (of the new experience. Of particular importance are any inconsistencies between experience and understanding).

3. Abstract Conceptualization (Reflection gives rise to a new idea, or a modification of an existing abstract concept).

4. Active Experimentation (the learner applies them to the world around them to see what results).

Effective learning is seen when a person progresses through a cycle of four stages: of (1) having a concrete experience followed by (2) observation of and reflection on that experience which leads to (3) the formation of abstract concepts (analysis) and generalizations (conclusions) which are then (4) used to test hypothesis in future situations, resulting in new experiences.

Kolb (1974) views learning as an integrated process with each stage being mutually supportive of and feeding into the next. It is possible to enter the cycle at any stage and follow it through its logical sequence.

However, effective learning only occurs when a learner is able to execute all four stages of the model. Therefore, no one stage of the cycle is an effective as a learning procedure on its own.

Learning Styles were developed by Peter Honey and Alan Mumford, based upon the work of Kolb, and they identified four distinct learning styles or preferences: Activist, Theorist; Pragmatist and Reflector, although it is possible to have traits from more than one. If this is the case with a learner it means that he or she will be able to learn well in more than one way. Learning styles are the learning approaches that individuals naturally prefer and they recommend that in order to maximise one's own personal learning each learner ought to:

- understand their learning style
- seek out opportunities to learn using that style

To understand your particular learning style Honey and Mumford have developed a [Learning Style Questionnaire](docs/learning-styles-questionnaire-honey-and-mumford.doc) and with this information you will be in a far better position to do three really useful things [quoting P. Honey]:

- Become smarter at getting a better fit between learning opportunities and the way you learn best. This makes your learning easier, more effective and more enjoyable. It saves you tackling your learning on a hit-and-miss basis. Equipped with information about your learning preferences, you'll have many more hits and fewer misses.
- Expand the 'band width' of experiences from which you derive benefit. Becoming an all-round learner, increases your versatility and helps you learn from a wide variety of different experiences - some formal, some informal, some planned and some spontaneous.
- Improve your learning skills and processes. Increased awareness of how you learn, opens up the whole process to self-scrutiny and improvement. Learning to learn is your most important capability since it provides the gateway to everything else you want to develop.

|Learning style|What activities different styles relate to|
|---------------------|---------------|
|Activist|Brainstorming, problem solving, group discussion, puzzles, competitions, role-play|
|Theorist|Models, statistics, stories, quotes, background information, applying theories|
|Reflector|Paired discussions, self analysis questionnaires, personality questionnaires, time out, observing activities, feedback from others, coaching, interviews|
|Pragmatist|Time to think about how to apply learning in reality, case studies, problem solving, discussion|

How to apply these?

- No chance of running a questionnaire at the beginning!
- Must consider that you will have a mix of styles in your group, so need to provide learning materials / activities that will apply to many

Learning activities: main thing to remember:

- People can only concentrate for short periods – often 15 – 20 minutes at most, before it drops
- For lecture sessions – intersperse with activities eg questions, short problems, discussion points
- For practical sessions – check on where the group as a whole is, or have demonstrators who can move around the room
