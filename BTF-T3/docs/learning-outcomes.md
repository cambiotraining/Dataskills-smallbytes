## Writing Learning Outcomes using the Bloom's Taxonomy

#### Learning Outcomes should be SMART
||||
|---------------------|---------------|--------------|
|Specific|They should state clearly what the student should know/be able to do, and at what level|What?|
|Measurable|You should be able to conceive of how their attainment might be assessed|By trainee / trainer or both?|
|Achievable| By the learners|Is it possible in this context?|
|Realistic|Could be seen as similar to attainability, but refers to their appropriateness to the overall task. "Valid" in assessment-speak|Can we really train them to do this?|
|Time-limited|Or achievable within the time-span of the session/lesson/course|In what time?|

#### From taxonomy to verbsâ€¦

**Verbs that are often used but are better to avoid because they are open to many interpretations**: appreciate, have faith in, know, learn, understand, believe.

|---------------------|---------------|---------------|
|Knowledge | The successful student will recognize or recall learned information| list, record, underline, state, define, arrange, name, relate, describe, tell, recall, memorise, recall, repeat, recognise, label, select, reproduce|
|Comprehension|The successful student will restate or interpret information in their own words|explain, describe, report, translate, express, summarise, identify classify, discuss, restate, locate, compare, review, illustrate, tell, critique, estimate, reference, interpret, reiterate|
|Application|The successful student will use or apply the learned information|apply, sketch, perform, use, solve, respond, practice, construct, role-play, demonstrate, conduct, execute, complete, dramatise, employ|
|Analysis|The successful student will examine the learned information critically|analyse, inspect, test, distinguish, catergorise, critique, differenciate, catalogue, diagnose, appraise, quantify, extrapolate, calculate, measure, theorise, experiment, relate, debate|
|Synthesis|The successful student will create new models using the learned information| develop, revise, compose, plan, formulate, collect, build, propose, construct, create, establish, prepare, design, integrate, devise, organise, modify, manage|
